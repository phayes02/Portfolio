                    <h3>Lab Computer</h3>
                    <p>In our Foundation of Computer Services course we built on our computer for our lab. We were given a $500 budget to buy parts to put it together. There were some alternatives to this, for one if there were parts in the lab that was avaliable you could use those instead of purchasing a new one. Another thing was that we could use parts from our previous lab machine if we replaced them with something else. I was able to purchase all the parts necessary other than a grpahics card. Mainly because during this time was the chip shortage and graphic card prices skyrocketed, so I took the one out of my old lab pc and replaced it. Unfortunaley that was not the only issue, at the time I did not know about it then but the BIOS on the motherboard was not compatible with the CPU that I purchased. This was a pain to fix, but using an older generation CPU I was able to update the BIOS, fixing the issue.</p>

                    <h3>Mineral Oil Computer</h3>
                    <p>This is my senior project and let me tell you it was a fun one to make. My overall objective was to put hardware into an aqaurium and submerge it in minerial oil. The plastic top was more of a problem than it would have helped, so with the help of my mother we replaced the top with wood. In case if the machine is under any heavy use I put a radiator on top. Inside the tank is a pump that will push mineral oil up to the radiator for it get rid of the head and return cool mineral oil. This works similar to an AIO CPU cooler that you see in a pc. There are some changes that I would make if I could, but the parts are already submerged. Overall, this was a really fun project to do but man is it heavy. </p>

                    <h3>Personal Computer</h3>
                    <p>After Foundations class I decided to save up to build my own system. Although this was not built at HLG, I used my knowledge to build this without any problems on boot. It took me a very long time to build, but I did not want to make any mistakes. I plan on building another system that will use AMD Ryzen AM5 components, but that will be a later time. Maybe at a later time I will upgrade this system to what ever generation of components is out then, but someday I would like to water cool a computer. This case works well with water cool systems, so I may take advantage of that someday.</p>
