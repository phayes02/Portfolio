                <h1>My personal computer</h1>
                <p>After my first year of college, I saved up enough money throughout the year and bought parts to put together my own system. After taking it very slow, I was able to get a sucessful boot on the first power up.</p>

                <h1>Minerial Oil Computer</h1>
                <p>For my senior project, I decided to do a minerial oil submerged computer. I even decided that I was going to stick it inside of fish tank. Although it is not a necessity to stick a computer in minerial oil it is a great project if you want a computer that is more unique than others. </p>
