                <p>This part of the page covers programming projects that I have done here at HLG. Unfortunately, the programs that I was going to use here that we did in a programming fundamentals class are on Cengage and I cannot access them. </p>

                <h1>Lab Computer</h1>
                <p>This is my computer that I built for our Foundation of Computer Systems class. For me personally, it was the first computer that I built sucessfully. We were given a $550 budget to build it so I had to go cheap on some parts. </p>
